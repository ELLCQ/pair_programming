you said you would prefer to do an easier task.
After our lab work on Thursday morning I'm free until 15:00, do you want to spend some time with me to work on this project?

#Agree. I'll stay at Bragg building first floor, beside physics study room
#ignore file "pokemon_alter.py" for now, the new module doesn't work, issue solved time is unsure

#see pokemon_own.py to get the newest version of stats_calculate module
