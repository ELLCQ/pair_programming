Path A: Statistical Analysis (Recommended for beginners)
Time: 3-4 hours | Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐

Core Features:

Load and display Pokemon data with proper type conversion
Calculate average stats by Pokemon type
Find strongest Pokemon in each stat category
Compare stats between generations
Generate type effectiveness insights
Learning Focus: Data processing, statistical calculations, filtering

design:
import random
create useful dictionaries/lists
define necessary functions
introduction to the program for the user
direct the user to different functions based on what they want to do


functions to implement:
load pokemon @@@@@
search pokemon and display it's stats @@@
average stats by pokemon type @@@@@
Strongest pokemon in each stat category 
compare average stats of each generation @@@@
generate type effectiveness insights?
display menu - Can only be finished when all other functions completed

nice to haves:
randomise option on pokemon search @@@@ 
load weakest pokemon in each stat category
compare strongest of each generation
ask if the user knows types and tell them if they don't - menu option

#extra ideas are not in task requirements, I'm afraid there are not too much I can help; 
#no objection to <menu.py> if it compatible to mudulus, and can be integrated with mudulus;
#Request: explanation of <pokemonsearch.py>, as it's function can be included in <pokemonload.py>, were you trying to create a "clean list" #which only contains the data you may use?
#stats_compare_module will be uploaded once completed

#replying to your notes above, the extra ideas are just to show off anyway if I can bother to implement them,
#Yeah, I needed to seperate the load and search functions because other functions such as 'comparing stats between generations' require a clean list from the load function and adding the search to it would just cause problems.
